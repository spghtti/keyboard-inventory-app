# Keyboard-inventory-app

## About this project

A CRUD application to track a (fictional) keyboard store's inventory.

This is a solution to the Odin's Project's [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-inventory-application) to build an inventory application with Node and MongoDB.

## Features

- Look up information keyboards, brands, switches, and instances that are in the database.
- Add, update and delete inventory items and profiles. Deletion is only allowed if there's no associated objects.
- View a breakdown of current inventory and profiles in the database.
- Upload keyboard images to their profiles
