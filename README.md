# Keyboard-inventory-app

## About this project

A CRUD application to track a (fictional) mechanical keyboard store's inventory.

This is a solution to the Odin's Project's [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-inventory-application) to build an inventory application with Node and MongoDB.

## Features

- Create and update profiles of keyboards, brands, and switches.
- Upload keyboard images to their profiles.
- Create and update instances. You can mark them as in-stock, sold (with date), or returned.
- Retrieve a list of all items in the database. You may also view a breakdown of the total counts of inventory and profiles in the database.
